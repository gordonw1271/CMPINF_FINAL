## Project Description

We used data for Community center attendance(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/daily-community-center-attendance/resource/b7cb30c8-b179-43ff-8655-f24880b0f578) and air quality data (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality/resource/4ab1e23f-3262-4bd3-adbf-f72f0119108b) to determine the best neighborhood in pittsburgh. Gordon dealt with air quality and Kenechi dealt with attendance. 

We were canvas group 46

Our repository was made to determine the best neighborhood in pittsburg and to do that we used datasets containing the air quality of the neighborhoods and the attendance of community members in community centers in the neighborhoods to decide which environment is the safest and has the most vibrant community ultimately showing which neighborhood is the best.
