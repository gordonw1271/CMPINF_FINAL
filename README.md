## Project Description

We used data for [Community center attendance](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/daily-community-center-attendance/resource/b7cb30c8-b179-43ff-8655-f24880b0f578), [Change to parking](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality/resource/4ab1e23f-3262-4bd3-adbf-f72f0119108b) , [obesity rates](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-obesity-rates/resource/fce248f0-8697-4d2a-bbe0-2da826776bfa?view_id=623baf47-90d4-4745-b17f-6b1f14849d76), and [trees benefit](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da) to determine the best neighborhood in pittsburgh. Gordon dealt with air quality and Kenechi dealt with attendance, obesity, and trees.

We were canvas group 46

Our repository was made to determine the best neighborhood in pittsburg and to do that we used datasets containing the parking of the neighborhoods, the attendance of community members in community centers in the neighborhoods, the obesity rates of the neighborhoods, and the overall tree benefit in the neighborhoods to decide which environment is the safest, has the most vibrant community, and has the best foliage, ultimately showing which neighborhood is the best.
